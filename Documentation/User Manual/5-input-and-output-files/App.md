## Application Files

VECTO uses a numbers of files to save GUI settings and file lists. All files are text-based and can be changed outside of VECTO ***if VECTO is not running***.

### Settings.json
This file is located in VECTO's **config** folder. Here all parameters of the [Settings Dialog](#settings) are saved. The file uses the [JSON format](#json).


### Job / Cycle lists
The job and cycle lists in the [Main Form](#main-form) are saved in the **joblist.txt** / **cyclelist.txt** files of the **config** folder.

Both files save the full file paths separated by line breaks. Additionally it is saved whether each file's checkbox is checked or not. "?1" after a file path means the file is checked (otherwise "?0"). However, this information can be omitted in which case the file will be loaded in checked state.

### LOG.txt
The tabulator-separated log file saves all messages of the [Main Form's Message List](#main-form) and is located in VECTO's program directory. The file is restarted whenever the [Logfile Size Limit](#settings) is reached.One backup is always stored as LOG\_backup.txt.
